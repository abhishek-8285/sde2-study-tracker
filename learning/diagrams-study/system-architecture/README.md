# 🏛️ System Architecture Diagrams

## 🎯 **Overview**

Large-scale system architecture diagrams for designing and documenting enterprise and distributed systems. Critical for system design interviews and senior engineering roles.

## 📚 **Diagram Types**

### **1. [System Context Diagrams](./01-system-context.md)** ⭐ **Interview Essential**

- **Purpose**: System boundaries and external interactions
- **Best For**: High-level system overview, stakeholder communication
- **Interview Usage**: Very High - Start every system design with this

### **2. [Layered Architecture](./02-layered-architecture.md)** ⭐ **Foundation**

- **Purpose**: Enterprise application layer organization
- **Best For**: Monolithic applications, clear separation of concerns
- **Real-world**: Spring Boot, .NET Core, Django applications

### **3. [Microservices Architecture](./03-microservices-architecture.md)** ⭐ **Modern Standard**

- **Purpose**: Distributed system design and service boundaries
- **Best For**: Scalable systems, team independence, technology diversity
- **Interview Usage**: Very High - Most system design questions

### **4. [Service-Oriented Architecture](./04-soa-patterns.md)**

- **Purpose**: Enterprise service integration patterns
- **Best For**: Large organizations, legacy system integration
- **Focus**: ESB, service contracts, governance

## 🚀 **Learning Priority for SDE2+**

1. **System Context** - Master first (1-2 days)
2. **Microservices Architecture** - Core modern skill (1 week)
3. **Layered Architecture** - Foundation knowledge (2-3 days)
4. **SOA Patterns** - Enterprise context (2-3 days)

## 💼 **Interview Focus**

### **Must-Know for System Design:**

- How to start with system context
- Microservices vs monolith trade-offs
- Service communication patterns
- Scalability and reliability patterns

### **Common Questions:**

- "Design a social media platform" → Microservices architecture
- "Design a payment system" → Service boundaries and reliability
- "Design a video streaming service" → Layered + microservices hybrid

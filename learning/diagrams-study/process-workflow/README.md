## üéØ **Overview**

Model business processes, development workflows, and operational procedures. Essential for process optimization, team coordination, and business analysis.

## üìö **Diagram Types**

### **1. [Business Process Model (BPMN)](./01-bpmn-diagrams.md)** ‚≠ê **Industry Standard**

- **Purpose**: Standard business process notation
- **Best For**: Cross-team processes, compliance documentation, process optimization
- **Components**: Tasks, gateways, events, pools, lanes

### **2. [Swimlane Diagrams](./02-swimlane-processes.md)**

- **Purpose**: Cross-functional process flows with clear responsibilities
- **Best For**: Development workflows, customer journey mapping
- **Focus**: Role separation, handoff points, accountability

### **3. [Value Stream Mapping](./03-value-stream.md)**

- **Purpose**: Process efficiency analysis with metrics
- **Best For**: DevOps optimization, lean process improvement
- **Metrics**: Lead time, process time, wait time, efficiency ratios

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

1. **Learn BPMN Basics** (2 days) - Industry standard notation
2. **Practice Swimlanes** (1 day) - Development team processes
3. **Apply Value Stream** (1-2 days) - Optimization projects

## üíº **SDE2+ Applications**

- **Team Leadership**: Document and optimize development processes
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline optimization and metrics

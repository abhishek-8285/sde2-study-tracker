## üìñ How to Use This Guide

### For SDE2 Interview Preparation:

1. **Start with Docker** - Foundation for containerization concepts
2. **Progress to Kubernetes** - Essential for modern deployment discussions
3. **Master Monitoring** - Critical for production system discussions
4. **Learn Kafka** - Important for distributed systems architecture
5. **Implement Quality Processes** - Demonstrates engineering maturity

### For Practical Implementation:

1. **Hands-on Labs** - Set up each technology in your development environment
2. **Integration Projects** - Build end-to-end workflows combining multiple tools
3. **Production Scenarios** - Apply concepts to real-world deployment challenges
4. **Best Practices** - Follow industry standards and security guidelines

## üîß Prerequisites

Before diving into this guide, you should have:

- **Basic Linux/Unix** command line proficiency
- **Git version control** experience
- **Basic networking** concepts (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS)
- **Cloud platform** familiarity (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- **Programming experience** in any language
- **Understanding of web applications** and APIs

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Set up local environment** with Docker and kubectl
2. **Choose a cloud provider** for hands-on practice
3. **Start with Section 2 (Docker)** for foundational concepts
4. **Follow sequential order** for structured learning
5. **Practice with real projects** applying learned concepts

## üìä Learning Path Recommendations

### For FAANG SDE2 Preparation:

Focus order: 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 1

**Rationale:** Container and orchestration skills are fundamental, followed by observability (critical for scale), event streaming (distributed systems), and quality processes.

### For Startup/Scale-up SDE2:

Focus order: 2 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1

**Rationale:** Docker for rapid deployment, Kafka for event-driven architecture, monitoring for reliability, then Kubernetes as you scale.

### For Enterprise SDE2:

Focus order: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 4

**Rationale:** Quality processes first (critical in enterprise), then containerization, orchestration, monitoring, and finally event streaming.

🐛 Debugging Story: The Case of the Missing Bean

Yesterday's coding session taught me a valuable lesson about Spring's dependency injection!

❌ The Problem:

```
NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type 'UserService'
```

This error was driving me crazy for 2 hours! 😤

🔍 The Investigation:
• Checked component scanning paths ✅
• Verified @Service annotation ✅  
• Debugged configuration classes ✅
• Restarted application 10 times ✅
• Still failing... 🤔

💡 The Aha Moment:
Found the real culprit - circular dependency!

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private OrderService orderService; // Needs OrderService
}

@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService; // Needs UserService
}
```

Each service was waiting for the other to be created first!

✅ The Solution:

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Lazy  // This breaks the circular dependency!
    @Autowired
    private OrderService orderService;
}
```

📚 Lessons Learned:
• Spring's error messages are actually pretty helpful once you know how to read them
• Circular dependencies are more common than you think
• @Lazy annotation is a lifesaver for breaking cycles
• Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most elegant
• Take breaks when debugging - fresh eyes see more!

🎯 Pro Tip: Use `spring.main.allow-circular-references=true` for quick testing, but fix the architecture issue properly!

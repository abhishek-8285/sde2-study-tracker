ðŸ§  Deep Dive: Understanding Spring Boot's Magic

Week 2, Day 1: Unraveling how Spring Boot auto-configuration actually works under the hood.

ðŸŽ¯ Mind = Blown Moments:
â€¢ @SpringBootApplication is actually 3 annotations in disguise:

- @Configuration (defines beans)
- @EnableAutoConfiguration (magic happens here)
- @ComponentScan (finds your components)

â€¢ Auto-configuration uses conditional beans (genius!):

```java
@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)
@ConditionalOnMissingBean(DataSource.class)
public DataSource dataSource() {
    // Spring creates this ONLY if conditions are met
}
```

â€¢ Actuator gives you production-ready monitoring for FREE
â€¢ Embedded servers eliminate deployment complexity

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:
Spring Boot isn't magic - it's incredibly well-engineered conventions over configuration. Understanding the "why" behind auto-configuration makes you 10x more effective.

ðŸ”§ Today's Challenge:
Built a custom starter for common utility functions. Amazing how much boilerplate this eliminates across projects!

ðŸ“š Learning Tip:
Use `@EnableAutoConfiguration(debug=true)` to see exactly what Spring Boot is configuring for you. Eye-opening!

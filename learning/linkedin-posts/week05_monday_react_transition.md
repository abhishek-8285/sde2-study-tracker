⚛️ Plot Twist: Diving into React After Mastering Spring Boot!

Starting Week 5 with a completely different mindset - switching from backend to frontend development.

🎯 The Challenge:
After spending a month thinking in terms of APIs and databases, now I need to think in components and state management!

🧠 Key Mental Shifts:
• From request/response → reactive updates
• From database queries → component props  
• From server state → client state management
• From HTTP status codes → user experience
• From SQL joins → component composition

💡 Already Learning:
React 18's concurrent features are mind-blowing! The way useTransition handles priority updates is pure genius:

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

// High priority: User input
setQuery(newValue);

// Low priority: Expensive computation
startTransition(() => {
  setFilteredResults(computeExpensiveFilter(newValue));
});
```

🔄 Connecting the Dots:
The REST API I built last week? Perfect backend for the React frontend I'm building this week. Full-stack development starts making sense!

🎓 Mindset Shift:
Backend = "How do I process data efficiently?"
Frontend = "How do I present data beautifully?"

Both require the same problem-solving skills, just different perspectives!

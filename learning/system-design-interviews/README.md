## 🏗️ **System Design Interview Framework**

### **1. Clarification Phase (5 minutes)**

```
❓ Ask the Right Questions:
• What is the scale? (users, requests, data volume)
• What features are most important?
• What are the performance requirements?
• Are there any specific constraints?
• What are the success metrics?
```

### **2. Estimation Phase (5 minutes)**

```
📊 Back-of-envelope Calculations:
• Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
• Read/Write ratio
• Storage requirements
• Bandwidth requirements
• Cache requirements
```

### **3. High-Level Design (15 minutes)**

```
🎨 Design Components:
• Draw major components
• Show data flow
• Identify key services
• Define APIs
• Choose databases
```

### **4. Detailed Design (20 minutes)**

```
🔍 Deep Dive:
• Database schema
• API design
• Caching strategy
• Scaling decisions
• Performance optimizations
```

### **5. Scale & Optimize (10 minutes)**

```
⚡ Handle Scale:
• Identify bottlenecks
• Horizontal scaling
• Performance improvements
• Monitoring and alerting
• Failure scenarios
```

## 📊 **Common System Design Patterns**

| Pattern             | Use Case                 | Pros                      | Cons                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Microservices**   | Large, complex systems   | Scalability, independence | Complexity, overhead   |
| **Event-Driven**    | Real-time systems        | Decoupling, scalability   | Eventual consistency   |
| **CQRS**            | Read/write separation    | Performance, flexibility  | Complexity             |
| **Saga Pattern**    | Distributed transactions | Fault tolerance           | Complex error handling |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Service resilience       | Fault isolation           | Added complexity       |

## 🎯 **Key Design Principles**

### **Scalability Principles**

- **Horizontal scaling** over vertical scaling
- **Stateless services** for better scaling
- **Database sharding** for data distribution
- **Caching layers** for performance
- **Asynchronous processing** for decoupling

### **Reliability Principles**

- **Redundancy** at every level
- **Circuit breakers** for fault tolerance
- **Health checks** and monitoring
- **Graceful degradation** under load
